# Solidity Recursive Call Vulnerability Example
A dapple project simulating a simple recursive call vulnerability

# Try it out yourself
Install dapple with:
```
$ npm install -g dapple
```
Clone the repo:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/karlfloersch/recursive-call-vulnerability-example.git
```
`cd` into the repo:
```
$ cd recursive-call-vulnerability-example
```
Run dapple test:
```
$ dapple test
```

The output should look something like:
```
...
